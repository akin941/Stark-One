# Measurements

Two kinds of figures live here and must never be confused (ADR-0011,
TESTING.md §1.1):

* **Simulated (informational)** — produced by Wokwi. Timing figures are trend data
  only and are **never** a pass/fail gate; memory and counters are deterministic
  and *are* simulation gates (heap, leak deltas, dropped events).
* **Hardware (gated, V1 prototype)** — measured on the physical breadboard. This is
  where every performance gate lives. Empty until V1.

## Simulated (informational)

Environment: Wokwi, `board-esp32-s3-devkitc-1` configured as the N16R8 SKU (16 MB
flash, 8 MB octal PSRAM declared, `CONFIG_SPIRAM` off — ADR-0014), firmware built
with `espressif/idf:v6.1` from a clean `sdkconfig`, SPI 40 MHz, band height 40.

| Date | Task | Metric | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-27 | STARK-0021 | Boot to root menu (`boot: ui_ready in <N> ms`) | 568 ms | `v0-boot` serial log |
| 2026-09-27 | STARK-0016 | Full-screen refresh (`display: full refresh <N> ms`) | 119–159 ms (132 ms first recorded) | serial logs across runs |
| 2026-09-27 | STARK-0020 | Display Test continuous full-area refresh (`displaytest: fps=<N>`) | 5.5 fps | Display Test |
| 2026-09-27 | STARK-0021 | Application binary (`stark-one.bin`) | 253 120 B (0x3dcc0; 94 % of the 4 MB app partition free) | `idf.py build` |
| 2026-09-27 | STARK-0021 | Free internal heap at the root menu (`diag: heap=<n>`) — **gate ≥ 200 kB** | 315 352 B | `v0-boot`, checked by `scripts/test_wokwi.sh` |
| 2026-09-27 | STARK-0020 | Free heap after 10 launch/exit cycles of each app — **gate within 1 kB** | 319 556 → 319 556 B (Δ 0) | About screen, leak scenario |
| 2026-09-27 | STARK-0021 | Dropped events / render errors over the full scenario set — **gate 0** | 0 / 0 (peak queue depth 1) | throwaway stats build, all three scenarios |

Wokwi's SPI timing is not the panel's, so the simulated refresh time and FPS say
nothing about the hardware targets; they are recorded to spot regressions in the
firmware's own per-band work between runs.

## Hardware (gated, V1 prototype)

To be filled in at the V1 prototype milestone (ROADMAP.md "V1 prototype"), with the
simulated figure above kept alongside for reference.

| Metric | Target | Measured | Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boot: ui_ready` from reset | ≤ 600 ms | | |
| First pixel from reset | ≤ 400 ms | | |
| Root menu frame rate | ≥ 20 FPS | | |
| Full-screen refresh at the chosen SPI clock | ≤ 60 ms (~25 ms SPI time at 40 MHz, ADR-0004) | | |
| Key-to-pixel latency, selection move | ≤ 50 ms | | |
| Frame overruns over a 60 s navigation session | 0 | | |
| Free internal heap at the root menu | ≥ 200 kB | | |
| Binary size | (record) | | |
| Current draw, idle / backlight on | (record) | | |

## V0 exit criteria — evidence (ROADMAP.md "V0")

| # | Criterion | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `idf.py build` clean, warnings-as-errors, pinned toolchain in CI | CI `firmware` job (`espressif/idf:v6.1`), 0 warnings on every merge STARK-0008…0021 |
| 2 | `v0-boot-and-menu` passes: boot → navigate → launch app → BACK | `test/scenarios/v0-boot-and-menu.yaml` via `scripts/test_wokwi.sh`, CI `wokwi` job |
| 3 | Host suite green, ≥ 80 % lines over the four pure cores | `scripts/test_host.sh --coverage`: `stark_event_core` 100 %, `stark_gfx` 100 %, `input_core` 100 %, `ui_menu_model` 97 % |
| 4 | `boot: ui_ready in <N> ms` logged in order, value informational | `v0-boot` asserts it after `display: init` and `app: registry`; 568 ms recorded above, not asserted |
| 5 | Rendering correct: no seams, partial = requested region, full ≡ partial | STARK-0016: screenshots decoded against an exact pattern model (0 pixels differ), a 50×30 partial render changed exactly 1 500 pixels, 7 partial renders ≡ one full render; FPS logged only |
| 6 | ≥ 200 kB heap at the root menu; 10× launch/exit each app within 1 kB | `diag: heap=315352` (gated by `scripts/test_wokwi.sh`); leak run Δ 0 B (STARK-0020) |
| 7 | Zero dropped events and zero render errors over the scenario set | stats build over all three scenarios: dropped 0, render failures 0 |
| 8 | No `#ifdef` referencing the simulator | `scripts/check.sh` `no-wokwi-ifdef` and `no-wokwi-mention` (`grep -ri wokwi components/ apps/ main/` empty) |
